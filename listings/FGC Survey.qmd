#### **Overview**

I hosted a survey measuring metrics that drove attendance to local tournaments from a sample of 500+ members from the FGC community at Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Esports.

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### **Learning Outcomes**

-   Weekends Matter: 68% preferred tournaments to be hosted on Fridays or Saturdays over weekdays.
-   Stream Quality is Prestigious: For viewers, HD broadcasts were more important that the cash rewards.

### Preferred Tournament Features

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Simulated survey data
fgc_data <- data.frame(
  Feature = c("Prize Pool", "Stream Quality", "Venue", "Game Variety", "Schedule"),
  Importance = c(68, 92, 85, 78, 89)  # % ranking as "Very Important"
)

# Plot
ggplot(fgc_data, aes(x = reorder(Feature, Importance), y = Importance)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = Feature, yend = 0), color = "#E63946") +
  geom_point(size = 5, color = "#E63946") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "FGC Tournament Priorities",
    subtitle = "Stream quality > prize money for viewers",
    x = "",
    y = "% Ranking as 'Very Important'"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
