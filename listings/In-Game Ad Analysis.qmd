#### **Overview**

I built a real-time dashboard tracking player interactions with in-game ads (e.g., banner clicks, rewarded video completions) for a mobile RPG.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### **Outcomes**

-   Identified a 15% drop-off rate during unskippable adsâ€”led to A/B testing shorter formats.\
-   Top-performing ad placement: Main menu (pre-lobby) had a 22% higher CTR than post-match screens.\

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### **Key Skills Gained**

-   Google Analytics 4 (custom events)\
-   Tableau for visualizing player funnel drop-offs

### CTR by Ad Placement

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Simulated ad performance data
ad_data <- data.frame(
  Placement = c("Main Menu", "Post-Match", "Inventory", "Loading Screen"),
  CTR = c(22, 15, 8, 4),
  Drop_Off_Rate = c(15, 28, 42, 50)
)

# Plot
ggplot(ad_data, aes(x = reorder(Placement, -CTR), y = CTR)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#00B0F0") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(CTR, "%")), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "In-Game Ad Click-Through Rates (CTR)",
    subtitle = "Main menu ads perform best, but avoid loading screens",
    x = "Ad Placement",
    y = "CTR (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
