## About Me

I hold a [Business Administration Marketing Management
Degree]{.highlight} from California State Polytechnic University,
Pomona. From the moment I discovered a niche Disney game called Kingdom
Hearts on the PlayStation 2, I knew that I wanted to be a keyblade
wielder when I grew up. However, (obviously) that dream became a bit
impractical. I figured I was better at wielding the pen and paper,
especially after the keyblade I made out of foam boards and a wooden
dowel broke mid-battle against the darkness (a.k.a. my stuffed animals).
These days, Iâ€™ve leveled up with the mouse and keyboard finding new
creative aspirations, avenues and ways I can get insomnia. A couple of
them being *League of Legends* and *Valorant*, graphic design and
Esports coordination.
