From the moment I discovered a niche Disney game called Kingdom Hearts on the PlayStation 2, I knew that I wanted to be a keyblade wielder when I grew up. However, (obviously) that dream became a bit impractical. I figured I was better at wielding the pen and paper, especially after the keyblade I made out of foam boards and a wooden dowel broke mid-battle against the darkness (a.k.a. my stuffed animals). These days, I’ve leveled up with the mouse and keyboard finding new creative aspirations, avenues and ways I can get insomnia. A couple of them being League of Legends and Valorant, graphic design and Esports coordination."
